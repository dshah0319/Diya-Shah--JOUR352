                        We know that social media is bad for young people, who
                        need more time—and freedom—offline. But the collective
                        will to fix this problem is hard to find.

                        The exact causes of the Gen Z mental-health emergency
                        will be parsed for years to come, but the severity of
                        the crisis itself is, at this point, beyond question.
                        Members of Gen Z, who were born between the mid-to-late
                        nineties and the early twenty-tens, tend to be lonelier
                        than the members of previous generations. They are more
                        anxious and depressed; they get less sleep. They more
                        commonly think that their lives hold no meaning. They
                        are more likely to harm themselves or experience
                        suicidal ideation. (Suicide deaths among children ages
                        ten to fourteen more than doubled between 2007 and
                        2017.) They are more wary of, or just less interested
                        in, the things that were once milestones of freedom:
                        drinking, dating, having sex, getting driver’s licenses,
                        moving out of their parents’ houses.

                        “On average,” the social psychologist and N.Y.U.
                        professor Jonathan Haidt writes in “The Anxious
                        Generation: How the Great Rewiring of Childhood Is
                        Causing an Epidemic of Mental Illness,” “people born in
                        and after 1996 were different, psychologically, from
                        those who had been born just a few years earlier.” From
                        childhood, Haidt suggests, they suffer from a weak
                        “psychological immune system—the ability of a child to
                        handle, process, and get past frustrations, minor
                        accidents, teasing, exclusion, perceived injustices, and
                        normal conflicts without falling prey to hours or days
                        of inner turmoil.” This immunosuppression persists into
                        adolescence and beyond, fostering higher proportions of
                        nervous, avoidant young adults.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For Haidt, the explanation is partly cultural and partly
                        technological. The oldest members of Gen Z were in
                        middle school in 2009 and 2010, when Facebook added the
                        Like button, Twitter added the Retweet option, and
                        smartphones’ front-facing cameras became ubiquitous,
                        launching the age of the selfie. The effect of these
                        tools, Haidt writes, was to attach kids to “a firehose
                        of social comparison” that pummelled their self-esteem
                        at a critical moment of cognitive and psychological
                        development. Studies show that, the more kids use social
                        media, the more likely they are to experience anxiety
                        and depression; girls, Black children, and L.G.B.T.Q.
                        youth are hit hardest. (Boys over all, hypnotized by
                        porn and video games, don’t fare hugely better than
                        girls.) And constant discussion and self-diagnosis of
                        mental-health disorders on TikTok, Instagram, and
                        elsewhere may contribute to what two University of
                        Oxford researchers call “prevalence inflation,” in which
                        people mistake everyday stress and discomfort as signs
                        of a serious disorder “in a way that is ultimately
                        self-fulfilling.” As an example, the scholars note that
                        “interpreting low levels of anxiety as symptomatic of an
                        anxiety disorder might lead to behavioural avoidance,
                        which can further exacerbate anxiety symptoms.”

                        By the time that smartphones and social media were
                        becoming omnipresent, in the late two-thousands and
                        early twenty-tens, children were also spending less and
                        less time engaged in unstructured, largely unsupervised
                        play with their peers. This deprivation owed to their
                        parents’ concerns for their safety—a fretfulness known
                        as “safetyism”—and to a competitive, college-fixated
                        mind-set that prioritized adult-led, résumé-building,
                        and “enrichment” activities. Unaccompanied kids doing
                        normal kid things like walking home from school or
                        visiting a playground became conspicuous, strange,
                        perhaps even the subject of a 911 call or a C.P.S.
                        investigation. The suburban or small-town nine-year-old
                        who, a generation before, would have been running around
                        outside with the other neighborhood kids all afternoon
                        is now indoors, staring at her phone.

                        Alas, for her, children who miss out on free play are
                        worse at taking risks, reading social cues, making
                        friends, and resolving conflicts. Improvisational,
                        unmonitored play functions as exposure therapy for life
                        itself. In a commentary published last year in The
                        Journal of Pediatrics which summarized the causal links
                        between free play and mental health, the authors
                        declared that “the decline in children’s independent
                        activity and, hence, in mental wellbeing is a national
                        and international health crisis and should be treated as
                        such.”

                        Of course, fretting about the deficiencies of
                        contemporary youth is an ancient tradition. Elders have
                        always overreacted to the supposedly mind-altering
                        properties of certain technological advancements, from
                        the printing press to the television set. Haidt is one
                        of America’s more prominent hand-wringers about kids
                        these days, owing to a viral Atlantic piece that he
                        co-authored, in 2015, with the attorney and free-speech
                        activist Greg Lukianoff, headlined “The Coddling of the
                        American Mind.” In that article, and in the 2018 book of
                        the same name, Haidt and Lukianoff portrayed a
                        bubble-wrapped generation that had been raised to be
                        “fragile, anxious, and easily hurt,” and railed against
                        what they identified as a student-directed movement “to
                        scrub campuses clean of words, ideas, and subjects that
                        might cause discomfort or give offense.” The corrosive
                        cleaning agents, according to the authors, included
                        trigger warnings, spurious talk of “microaggressions,”
                        and demands for “safe spaces.” Haidt and Lukianoff
                        argued that Gen Z victims of safetyism were also, in
                        higher ed, its most aggressive perpetrators.

                        “The Coddling of the American Mind” was a somewhat
                        better book than its reactionary title promised, but
                        Haidt and Lukianoff’s reflexive disdain for left-leaning
                        youth and weakness for caricature had a flattening
                        effect on their analysis. Haidt had risen to
                        public-intellectual fame in the early two-thousands via
                        his work on positive psychology, but “Coddling” turned
                        him into a folk hero in a frequently specious war
                        against cancel culture, winning him fans among the
                        revanchist likes of Joe Rogan, Bari Weiss, and Jordan
                        Peterson. He has often taken a both-sides approach to
                        political conflict that equates leftist activism with
                        deadly right-wing extremism. (A section in “Coddling”
                        that deals with the 2017 “Unite the Right” rally of
                        white supremacists and the counter-demonstrators it
                        drew, in Charlottesville, is an especially egregious
                        example of this tendency.) He has been beset by a
                        troubling fixation on the heritability of I.Q.—a
                        contention widely dismissed as scientific racism—and the
                        purported accuracy of stereotypes. He once argued
                        against a proposal to diversify New York City’s
                        specialized high schools, saying that it would
                        exacerbate racism. On Twitter and Bluesky, I have
                        frequently doomscrolled past the balding, scruff-bearded
                        man who is the visual shorthand of the Clickhole classic
                        “Heartbreaking: The Worst Person You Know Just Made a
                        Great Point,” but I had never felt the heat of his
                        proud, stoic gaze until I found myself nodding along in
                        agreement with much of “The Anxious Generation.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The cognitive dissonance is especially uncomfortable
                        because “The Anxious Generation” is, to a considerable
                        extent, a reiteration and expansion of “Coddling.” But
                        it is also a vastly superior work. It’s less hung up on
                        campus-outrage stuff, and it benefits from six
                        additional years of research on how smartphones and
                        social media dice the nerves and tamp the spirits of
                        young people, particularly those between the ages of ten
                        and fifteen. These established links are now the stuff
                        of Surgeon General’s advisories, alarming C.D.C.
                        reports, and class-action lawsuits. What was maybe still
                        an educated guess even half a decade ago is now a grim,
                        clinical certainty.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There is also a surprising degree of certainty about
                        possible countermeasures for what Haidt sums up as
                        “overprotection in the real world and underprotection in
                        the virtual world.” In “The Anxious Generation,” Haidt
                        makes four core appeals to parents and educators: more
                        unstructured free play for children, no smartphones
                        before high school, no social media before age sixteen,
                        and no phones in schools. All of these strike me as not
                        just reasonable but irrefutably necessary. What is less
                        clear is whether there is enough collective and
                        institutional will to accomplish them.

                        During the past year, I’ve been interviewing parents who
                        have attempted to block or strictly limit their tween
                        and teen-age children’s use of smartphones and social
                        media. Conversations with these parents—all of whom live
                        in the New York City area, and whose kids attend a mix
                        of public, charter, and private schools—hit common
                        refrains. Parents worried about their kids saying or
                        doing something foolish that, if captured and circulated
                        via smartphone, would haunt them for the rest of their
                        lives. They were infuriated that tech companies, abiding
                        by federal law, effectively give kids online
                        emancipation from their parents at the arbitrary and
                        absurdly young age of thirteen and, even then, barely
                        bother with age verification. (One talked about
                        falsifying her kid’s birth date on Google’s Family Link
                        in order to keep full control over the service.) They
                        lamented the friction and distrust sown by devices—I
                        heard about kids who kept surreptitiously changing the
                        parental settings on their social media, or who have
                        finstas full of duck face and provocation, or who sneak
                        phones into their bedrooms and stay up with them all
                        night.

                    <p>
                        A thread of safetyism still prevails among these
                        parents. Some resisted buying their child a device but
                        felt they had no choice once the kid started taking the
                        subway or walking to school without adult accompaniment.
                        And I was surprised by the extent to which G.P.S.
                        location-tracking of kids is treated as a given, as
                        ubiquitous and indispensable as backpacks and sneakers.
                        Several parents said that they weren’t sure how to
                        balance preserving their children’s privacy—their
                        ability to have a sacred space carved out from their
                        parents to grow into themselves—and monitoring their
                        online and offline behavior in order to keep them safe.
                        One told me, “I am definitely a helicopter parent, and
                        my generation is full of helicopter parents, because
                        we’ve given them access to this, like, horrifying void.”

                    <p>
                        These parents noticed how lonely their kids often seem
                        to be, and how social media simultaneously fills and
                        widens that emptiness. Although online forums can
                        provide some of the togetherness that young people
                        crave, ideally, Haidt writes, most of their interactions
                        should unfold in person, unmediated by screens, which
                        requires emotional effort and investment. In reading
                        “The Anxious Generation” and speaking with parents, I
                        frequently thought about what the late literary and
                        cultural theorist Lauren Berlant called “the
                        inconvenience of other people”—the “affective sense of
                        the familiar friction of being in relation. At a
                        minimum, inconvenience is the force that makes one shift
                        a little while processing the world.” Using your mind
                        and body to interact extemporaneously with other minds
                        and bodies is a skill that dulled during the pandemic;
                        it can be boring, or frustrating, or distressing; it
                        demands time, compromise, and accommodation. The
                        inconvenient person, Berlant wrote, is “someone you trip
                        over, even just in your mind.” Kids need to trip over
                        people and ideas, at the risk of scraping up their
                        psyches, in order to learn how to move through the world
                        and how to connect meaningfully with the people in it.

                        Many teens are aware that smartphones disrupt their
                        sleep, their moods, and their self-image, but they
                        believe, as several parents told me, that giving up
                        their phones would kill their social lives. Research has
                        shown that, when adolescents abstain from social media
                        for a while, their mental health improves even as their
                        isolation from their friends who are still on the
                        platforms increases; a smart, emotionally intelligent
                        kid can recognize the merits of this trade-off and still
                        choose to keep their TikTok and Snapchat accounts. (A
                        University of Chicago working paper published last year
                        found that fifty-seven per cent of college students who
                        are active users of Instagram would “prefer to live in a
                        world without the platform.”) One parent talked about
                        her daughter’s experience at a prestigious summer
                        program, where, not long after arriving, she found
                        herself sitting with a group of other new arrivals;
                        rather than getting acquainted, the rest of the kids
                        were all staring at their phones, and she didn’t have
                        one. She told her mother, “It was so stupid. But, in
                        that moment, I wanted to be stupid, too.”

                        Several of the parents favorably mentioned the Wait
                        Until 8th movement, which encourages parents to sign a
                        pledge not to give their children smartphones until the
                        end of eighth grade or later. But few parents expressed
                        much hope about forging collective action against
                        phones, in part because they didn’t know enough other
                        families who were sufficiently informed or exercised
                        about the risks. Haidt stresses that his core
                        recommendations require commitment from a critical mass
                        of parents, schools, and communities in order to weaken
                        the network effects of social media and free teen-agers
                        to pursue other means of fulfilling their God-given
                        right to be stupid together. But achieving this
                        threshold seems especially difficult in a large city.
                        “There’s just no way—it’s too big a cohort, there’s no
                        community, you don’t know who the parents are,” one
                        mother told me. “Maybe in a smaller town.” Another mom
                        was looking forward to summer, when her sixteen-year-old
                        would be going to camp with seven friends; the parents
                        all knew one another and had come to an agreement that
                        none of the kids would bring their phones with them.

                        The overwhelming consensus among these parents was that
                        schools should stringently limit or ban cell-phone use,
                        a measure that has growing legal momentum in some
                        states. Last year, Ron DeSantis, the governor of
                        Florida, signed a law that prohibits students’ use of
                        cell phones during instructional time and curtails the
                        use of TikTok in schools; just this week, he approved a
                        law barring children under age fourteen from holding
                        accounts on social-media platforms. Earlier this month,
                        Indiana’s governor, Eric Holcomb, signed a law requiring
                        school districts to implement policies banning phones,
                        tablets, and other devices in the classroom, with some
                        exceptions. Last year, Utah sued TikTok and Meta for
                        being addictive and harmful to children, and passed laws
                        tightening age-verification and parental-consent
                        requirements for social-media accounts; more recently,
                        Utah’s governor, Spencer Cox, has been urging principals
                        and school-board members across the state to remove cell
                        phones during class. At least three other states have
                        introduced legislation that would require or incentivize
                        schools to go phone free.

                        Individual schools that already enforce ironclad
                        no-phones policies seem to be ecstatic about their
                        results. Last year, the School of the Future, a public
                        school in Manhattan, began requiring students to use
                        Yondr phone-locking pouches for the entirety of the
                        school day. In March, the administration sent an e-mail
                        to parents describing the policy as a “massive success,”
                        citing “increased student engagement in the classroom,
                        less time spent in the bathrooms and hallways, more
                        genuine connections within the community and a decrease
                        in reports of cyberbullying.”

                    <p>
                        Surprisingly, though, the biggest opponents of the
                        movement for phone-free schools are parents. In a truly
                        apocalyptic essay for Slate titled “The Parents in My
                        Classroom,” a ninth-grade English teacher in Evanston,
                        Illinois, describes, among other abominations, a mother
                        who expected her kid to text her every class period, a
                        mother whose kid sent her a photograph of a quiz he was
                        in the middle of taking (she immediately e-mailed the
                        teacher to ask if her son could take it the next day),
                        and parents who ran surveillance on their children’s
                        classes via their school-issued Chromebooks. (One
                        mother, during a discussion of “Romeo and Juliet,” fired
                        off an e-mail with the subject line “I CAN HEAR
                        EVERYTHING AND I DON’T LIKE IT.”)

                    <p>
                        Despite the general consensus about kids and phones, the
                        increasing reliance of schools on tablets and laptops
                        means that most students are simply trading one screen
                        for another, with many remaining glued to some
                        permutation of social media, video games, and their
                        hovering parents. One mother told me that she smashed a
                        laptop to pieces when she discovered that her daughter,
                        who was forbidden to go on Instagram, had been using the
                        platform to message friends during classes. “There is
                        not one adult who will say, ‘Social media and constant
                        phone use is good for our kids,’ ” this parent said.
                        “And we’re not doing anything about it. It’s crazy.”

                    <p>
                        My children are seven and nine, not yet at the age when
                        all of their friends have smartphones. My perhaps naïve
                        hope rests in providing them enough freedom in the real
                        world now so that they never lose their taste for it,
                        lessening the chances that I will eventually lose them
                        to the horrifying void. Last year, my older child began
                        running errands around our Brooklyn neighborhood on her
                        own: picking up a few items at the grocery store,
                        dropping off a picture at the framing shop. She didn’t
                        carry a phone or a G.P.S. tracker, and I didn’t worry
                        about her getting lost or kidnapped. She was surrounded
                        by what Jane Jacobs called “eyes on the street.” I
                        considered the chances that a nosy stranger might call
                        the cops about a solo child, but those odds struck me as
                        low—mostly because my daughter is tall for her age, but
                        also because the guys at the Dominican bodega knew her,
                        and the guys at the Yemeni bodega knew her, and so did
                        any number of neighbors she would pass on the sidewalks.
                        The only possibility that really bothered me was the
                        risk of her getting hit by a car. Sometime during the
                        pandemic, the streets surrounding our apartment building
                        had turned into a homicidal four-wide drag race. I
                        warned her about an especially chaotic intersection, and
                        she promised that she’d cross it only if other people
                        were crossing at the same time—an ad-hoc buddy system.

                        The collective task of giving younger kids more physical
                        and psychological space to roam is daunting. It would
                        involve somehow loosening the grip of time-intensive
                        competitive-sports programs on entire communities. It
                        would require reversing decades-long trends not only in
                        the privatization of public space but in housing,
                        municipal planning, roadway design, and traffic-law
                        enforcement, which have rendered the U.S. one of the
                        least walkable developed countries in the world. It
                        would also demand undoing the safetyist mind-set.
                        However laissez-faire a parent might wish to be, if you
                        drop off your capable third grader for an afternoon of
                        free exploration around the Prospect Park ravine, you
                        can expect some questioning from an officer of the
                        Seventy-eighth Precinct later that day.

                        In “The Anxious Generation,” Haidt suggests one
                        relatively easy remedy, realizable in the short term,
                        that schools could take on themselves: opening their
                        playgrounds after school for “mixed-age, ‘loose parts’
                        free play,” in which kids don’t have access to phones
                        but otherwise have “nearly complete autonomy.” During
                        these sessions, adults, like lifeguards, would
                        “intervene only in the case of an emergency.” These play
                        clubs are, of course, geographically constrained, and
                        structured in their unstructuredness. Many schools may
                        lack the right sorts of playgrounds or may be scared off
                        by liability concerns. But it’s an idea—a start.

                        Haidt also praises “adventure playgrounds,” such as the
                        Yard, on Governors Island, in New York City, a
                        no-parents-allowed zone where children and teen-agers
                        are provided with tools and materials such as wood,
                        saws, hammers, nails, tires, paint, and fabric and given
                        near-free rein to create and destroy. The Yard, which
                        implicitly asks the question “What if ‘Lord of the
                        Flies’ had worked out?,” was one of my kids’ favorite
                        places in the whole city—my son would have gone every
                        weekend if we could have managed all the ferrying—and
                        I’ve never been inside it. A sign near the entrance
                        reads “your children are fine without advice &
                        suggestions.”

                        Last summer, my kids and I moved away from the city,
                        into a big house in a small town. As in many other
                        American places, the residential streets are eerily
                        quiet, even on the nicest afternoons, and much of family
                        life revolves around organized sports. There’s an
                        unfinished attic space above our garage, and, bored one
                        afternoon in early spring, the kids wandered in and
                        started tinkering. They ran the Shop-Vac over the floor
                        and laid down a rug with a rainbow on it and hung a
                        paper lantern from the low rafters. They found a pile of
                        old wooden boards and some nails and started hammering
                        the boards into the walls where insulation was exposed—a
                        kind of discount shiplap. A friend who fixes up and
                        sells houses for a living came over to make sure the
                        space was properly ventilated. From time to time, he
                        drops by and leaves little offerings at the attic door—a
                        crate full of loose tools, a standing fan. I don’t go
                        into the attic unless I’m invited.

                        The best day was when the kids found a bunch of old
                        paint samples and painted the exterior attic door with a
                        splotch of International Klein Blue that you can see
                        from way up the street. There were still some loose
                        boards lying around, so they painted those green and
                        yellow and then hammered them into place—not the order
                        of operations that I would have recommended, but I am
                        not the one in charge. They banged away at it for hours
                        while I sat inside, mostly undisturbed, reading about
                        what comes next.
