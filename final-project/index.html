                        We know that social media is bad for young people, who
                        need more time—and freedom—offline. But the collective
                        will to fix this problem is hard to find.

                        The exact causes of the Gen Z mental-health emergency
                        will be parsed for years to come, but the severity of
                        the crisis itself is, at this point, beyond question.
                        Members of Gen Z, who were born between the mid-to-late
                        nineties and the early twenty-tens, tend to be lonelier
                        than the members of previous generations. They are more
                        anxious and depressed; they get less sleep. They more
                        commonly think that their lives hold no meaning. They
                        are more likely to harm themselves or experience
                        suicidal ideation. (Suicide deaths among children ages
                        ten to fourteen more than doubled between 2007 and
                        2017.) They are more wary of, or just less interested
                        in, the things that were once milestones of freedom:
                        drinking, dating, having sex, getting driver’s licenses,
                        moving out of their parents’ houses.
