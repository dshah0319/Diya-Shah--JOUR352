            As part of the press committee, I coordinate with venues and produce
            coverage for concerts and shows in the form of previews or reviews.
            As a member of the zine team, I wrote two articles and helped to
            format the Fall ‘23 zine.

            I organized and set up catered events and sports games on the
            University of Maryland’s campus as part of a team. In my role I
            served and refilled food and drinks for patrons at the event,

            I organized, set up, and helped lead monthly executive board
            meetings. I oversaw the book drop and shelving processes at the
            library and designed creative displays every month. I was
            responsible for proposing new ideas for the library and its patrons,
            some of which included a community night and a teen book club. I
            occasionally was in charge of virtually hosting various educational
            panels for the library.

        <p>
            As a dishwasher, I washed and organized all dishes, silverware, and
            cookware. I was placed in charge of cleaning up the kitchen and
            facilitating the shutdown of the back of the restaurant. As a line
            cook, I assisted chefs in food preparation and plated dishes for
            customers.

        <p>
            I assisted the lead director in two different children’s musical
            productions. As the assistant director, I developed stimulating
            learning games and engaging activities for children ages 5-12 and
            formulated blocking and stage directions to teach to the students. I
            worked on and operated the sound and light board for all rehearsals
